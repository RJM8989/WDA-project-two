    <p>Word scramble is a game where the letters that can make a meaningful word are shuffled or scrambled randomly, and players have to find out the correct word using those random letters.
       In the game, there is a hint too that helps the user to find the correct word easily. Players have to find the correct word in the given time which is 30 seconds. 
        If the current word is difficult to find there is a refresh button to get a new word. For every correct word you will get 1 point. Have fun and try to get the best score!</p>
